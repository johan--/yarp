 *   - When a thread owns a RecursiveMutex, all other threads will block (for calls to lock) or receive a false return value (for tryLock) if they attempt to claim ownership of the RecursiveLock.
 * The behavior of a program is undefined if a RecursiveMutex is destroyed while still owned by some thread.
 * The behavior of a program is undefined if a RecursiveMutex is unlocked by a thread which is not
 * currently owning the RecursiveMutex
